## About this prototype
So..., where to start:
Ok
1. This prototype was made with "Touhou Project" in mind (but not all mechanics where implemented (maybe I should drink more beer))
2. I often forgot that this was a prototype and not a full game. Therefore, some things could have been done simpler, which would have saved time.
3. UI masking created according to this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoiNP5IfBBo
